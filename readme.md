# Desafio MTE

Data analysis challenge from MTE - UNICAMP, where we need to select the perfect room for our client from a AirBnb accommodations database, my group ended up disqualified because we delivered 6 results based on the premise that the tourism agency should have at least some options to book their client, but the challenge was to select only one place.


But in the final score in Creativity, Analysis Quality, Presentation and Viability of the solution we ended in Fourth Place, among more than 30 groups.
